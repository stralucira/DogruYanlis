This game is played with any number of players, entering claims about themselves into the game. 
After everyone submits their claims and marks their truthfulness, the game begins.

In every turn, a claim is revealed. Players discuss IRL and decide on who they think has said this claim and if its true or not.

If no one guesses the person who wrote the claim, the owner of the claim gets double points.
Otherwise, players who have correctly guessed both the person and the claim's truthfulness gets awarded a point.

The player with the most point wins the game after all claims have been revealed and voted on.
